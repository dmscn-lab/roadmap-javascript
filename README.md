Content studied based on the step-by-step guide to learn JavaScript in 2022 by [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/javascript)

## Get Started
- How can this repository help me?
  - In this repo you will find code examples and explanations in my view on a certain topic.
- How is the content structure?
  - Most of the files you will find here will be in markdown.
- What is the purpose of the project?
  - Have a little more guidance when studying about JavaScript.

## What is JavaScript?
>"JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It lets us add interactivity to pages e.g. you might have seen sliders, alerts, click interactions, popups, etc on different websites -- all of that is built using JavaScript. Apart from being used in the browser, it is also used in other non-browser environments as well such as Node.js for writing server-side code in JavaScript, Electron for writing desktop applications, React Native for mobile applications, and so on."
